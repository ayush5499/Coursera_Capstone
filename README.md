## Introduction

This is a capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. In this project, I am creating a hypothetical scenario for a concept that there may not be enough Indian Restaurants in Toronto Area. Therefore it might be a great opportunity for an entrepreneur who is based in Canada.

The objective of this capstone project is to find the most suitable location for the entrepreneur to open a new Indian Restaurant in Toronto, Canada. By using data science methods and tools along with machine learning algorithms such as clustering, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the business question: In Toronto, if an entrepreneur wants to open an Indian Restaurant, where should they consider opening it?

## Data

To solve this problem, we will need below data:
* List of neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada
* Latitude and Longitude of these neighborhoods
* Venue data related to Indian restaurants. This will help us find neighborhoods that are more suitable to open an Indian Restaurant.
