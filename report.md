Introduction/Business Problem

Road accidents are a big problem for the local authorities, emergency staff and also the people travelling on road near the accident sites.
We look to build a system that takes in the road, environment and neighbourhood conditions and lets the user know the risk of their travel that day.


Data

To solve the problem at hand we use the data from Seattle city as our basis for development of the model. We make a assumption that the data is a good generalisation of driving and accident patterns for the whole country. 
Data set comes SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group database of all accidents in Seattle. Data has 194673 entries and consists of 37 feature fields.
